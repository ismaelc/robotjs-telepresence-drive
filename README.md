![](https://i.postimg.cc/9f92nWs9/Screen-Shot-2019-07-11-at-12-45-53-PM.png)

A small server that uses `robotjs` to drive the Beam telepresence robot (by SuitableTech) via API calls. 

This project was used with [another project](https://github.com/ismaelc/programmable-teachable-boilerplate) that determines when/how these robot-driving API calls are called.

## Install and Run
```
npm install
node robotserver.js
```
